# BedWars Client
This client adds a lot of convenience to BedWars gameplay, such as notifications, Team HUD, item counts in generators, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> This client may be considered a cheat client by many servers, so use it at your own risk!

-----
## Installing
To install the client, simply build it using Java 8 or download the ready version from Releases, and then put it in the mods folder on Forge 1.8.9.
Additionally, if you want to achieve synchronization between clients, enable server.js and change the IP&Port in the code to enable connecting

# Synchronization

The clients are interconnected, so if one player doesn't have database chunks loaded and another does, they'll still receive notifications about what's happening.
In addition, clients can send messages to each other, quickly join parties, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Available commands:
>  **/bw-base** (manually launch the base)
>  **/bw-party** (create a party between clients)
>  **/bw-mess [message]** (Message to clients)

## Team Hud
Team Hud is nothing more than information about your teammates

## Incomming Info
This is one of the most useful things, i.e. infomming info, you can know when someone comes to your base or leaves it while being at the other end of the map

# Tactics
Tactics, a simple way to quickly attack the enemy base. There are two tactics you can choose from. Both involve all clients throwing the necessary items forward, and one client collecting them, purchasing the necessary items, and then, as a team, you can quickly destroy the other's bed.

# Holograms
Holograms are simply the number of items in a given diamond/emerald generator. They're useful when you don't want to go to islands with low item counts.
