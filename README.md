**A Minecraft client designed to make BedWars gameplay more convenient**

This client adds a great deal of convenience when playing BedWars. Your gameplay will be enhanced with additional features. Team HUD is included, item counts are shown above the generator, notifications inform you about players entering your base, and you can select tactics at the start of a round.

# Overview

The main panel under the right Shift key contains various client settings. These include, for example, region visualization at the start of a round, alerts for players, TNT and Fireball detection in your base, item counts above generators, Team HUD, and more.

Every option can be easily enabled or disabled, allowing you to quickly turn off anything you don’t find useful.

## Synchronization

The clients are interconnected, so if one player doesn't have database chunks loaded and another does, they'll still receive notifications about what's happening.
In addition, clients can send messages to each other, quickly join parties, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Available commands:
>  **/bw-base** (manually launch the base)
>  **/bw-party** (create a party between clients)
>  **/bw-mess [message]** (Message to clients)

## Team Hud
In the top-left corner of the screen, the stats of our teammates will be displayed, including their username, head icon, HP, and the number of items for the shop. This allows us to easily see who has which items when we want to borrow something from them.

## Incomming Info
Incoming Info is simply a notification that someone has entered your base. It is sent to the entire team and shows the username of the intruder along with their team indicated by color. This allows you to know when your base is being attacked and quickly return to defend it.

## Actions in base
Similar to Incoming Info, this feature shows what is currently happening in the base, such as when someone places TNT or throws a Fireball. These notifications are also sent to the entire team using the client.

## Tactics
Tactics, a simple way to quickly attack the enemy base. There are two tactics you can choose from. Both involve all clients throwing the necessary items forward, and one client collecting them, purchasing the necessary items, and then, as a team, you can quickly destroy the other's bed.

-----

## Holograms
Above the holograms, the number of items they contain is displayed, allowing us to avoid approaching a generator that is empty.
